Setup was:

```sh
git add _config.yml _posts
git commit -m "Initial Jekyll setup"
git push origin main
```

Then:

Enable GitHub Pages:

* repository on GitHub, then "Settings" -> "Pages"
* In the "Source" section, select "Deploy from a branch"
* Choose the `main` and the / (root) directory
* Click "Save"

GitHub Pages will now build and deploy your site. It usually takes a few minutes for the site to become live. The URL will be displayed on the GitHub Pages settings page

Site is live at https://spectrum-ferret.github.io/social/
